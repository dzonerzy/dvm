# Python VM - DVM
Python VM with simple custom assembly code

This is just an experimental project, based on a custom VM implementation with some "standard" opcodes, many things are still not implemented so, if you want to add your custom opcode add it to <b>core/opcodes.py</b> and then implement it in <b>core/vcpu.py</b>.

Feel free to contribute :)
